hmsCalculate Community Edition Installation Guide
hmsCalculate v1.1
Last Updated on April 23, 2015


[System Requirements]

hmsCalculate is written in Perl and uses the core language, a few additional
modules that were included with this package, and a few more modules that you
will need to install on your own.  Exactly which additional packages you need is
dependent on which operating system you intend to run hmsCalculate on.  See
OS-specific instructions below for more details.

At the very least, you will need to be able to run Perl5 and Tk on your
target machine in order to use the Community Edition of hmsCalculate.


[Installation Instructions]

* Linux, Unix, and Unix-like operating systems (Mac OS X users see below):
    
    1. Ensure that Perl5 is running on your local machine.  (Try running
    `perl -V` from the shell if you don't know whether it's already installed.
    If it's not, you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    2. Ensure that the Tk module has already been installed on your local
    machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use Tk;'` from the shell if you don't
    know whether it's already installed.  If you receive a message like, 
    "Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC" then it's not currently installed, and
    you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    3. Ensure that the XML::Simple module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use XML::Simple;'` from the shell if
    you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you receive an error
    message like, "Can't locate XML/Simple.pm in @INC" then it's not currently
    installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    4. At this point, you should have everything you need to run hmsCalculate,
    so unpack the contents of the source files into a local directory.  (This
    should create a new directory called "hmsCalculate" with all of the source
    files and support materials needed to build hmsCalculate locally.)
    
    5. Change your working directory to ./hmsCalculate/bin/ and double-check
    that hmsCalculate.pl is executable by you.
    
    6. Run hmsCalculate.pl via the `perl hmsCalculate.pl` command or the
    `./hmsCalculate.pl` command.
    
* Microsoft Windows

    1. Ensure that Perl5 is running on your local machine.  (Try running
    `c:\Perl\bin\perl -V` from an MS-DOS prompt if you don't know whether it's
    already installed.  If it's not, you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    2. Ensure that the Tk module has already been installed on your local
    machine.  (Try running `c:\Perl\bin\perl -e "use Tk;"` from an MS-DOS prompt
    if you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you receive a message
    like, "Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC" then it's not currently installed, and
    you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    3. Ensure that the XML::Simple module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `c:\Perl\bin\perl -e "use XML::Simple;"` from
    an MS-DOS prompt if you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you
    receive an error message like, "Can't locate XML/Simple.pm in @INC" then
    it's not currently installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    4. Ensure that the Tk::Icon module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `c:\Perl\bin\perl -e "use Tk::Icon;"` from
    an MS-DOS prompt if you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you
    receive an error message like, "Can't locate Tk/Icon.pm in @INC" then it's
    not currently installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    5. At this point, you should have everything you need to run hmsCalculate,
    so unpack the contents of the source files into a local directory.  (This
    should create a new directory called "hmsCalculate" with all of the source
    files and support materials needed to build hmsCalculate locally.)
    
    6. If you have already associated .pl files with your local Perl
    interpretor, change your working directory to \hmsCalculate\bin\ and double
    click the hmsCalculate.pl file.  If you have not already associated .pl
    files with your local Perl interpretor, open an MS-DOS prompt, navigate to
    the \hmsCalculate\bin\ directory and run the command
    `c:\Perl\bin\perl hmsCalculate.pl`
    
* Mac OS X:
    
    1. Ensure that Perl5 is running on your local machine.  (Try running
    `perl -V` from the shell if you don't know whether it's already installed.
    If it's not, you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    2. Ensure that the Tk module has already been installed on your local
    machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use Tk;'` from the shell if you don't
    know whether it's already installed.  If you receive a message like, 
    "Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC" then it's not currently installed, and
    you will need to install it on your own.)  NOTE:  I had difficulty
    installing Tk on OS X until I ran the standard CPAN shell as root and then
    forced the install.  My Tk installation hasn't seemed to encounter any
    problems as a result of the forced install, and hmsCalculate ran without any
    problems either.
    
    3. Ensure that the XML::Simple module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use XML::Simple;'` from the shell if
    you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you receive an error
    message like, "Can't locate XML/Simple.pm in @INC" then it's not currently
    installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    4. At this point, you should have everything you need to run hmsCalculate,
    so unpack the contents of the source files into a local directory.  (This
    should create a new directory called "hmsCalculate" with all of the source
    files and support materials needed to build hmsCalculate locally.)
    
    5. Change your working directory to ./hmsCalculate/bin/ and double-check
    that hmsCalculate.pl is executable by you.
    
    6. Run hmsCalculate.pl via the `perl hmsCalculate.pl` command or the
    `./hmsCalculate.pl` command.


[Miscellaneous Notes]

MS Windows users will most likely have a more difficult time time than Linux,
OS X, and Unix users getting hmsCalculate Community edition up and running,
because the latter three will probably have most of what they need already
installed on their machines.  MS Windows users, I recommend looking into
ActiveState's ActivePerl and Googling for ways to associate .pl with your local
Perl interpreter.  This should help hmsCalculate seem much more like a native
Windows application.  To all users, wherever possible, I recommend installing
the additional modules (Tk, XML::Simple, etc.) via your favorite package
manager.  (In the case of MS Windows users who have just installed ActivePerl,
this means the "Perl Package Manager" you just installed.)
