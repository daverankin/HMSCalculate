HMSCalculate Community Edition Installation Guide
HMSCalculate v1.0
Last Updated on March 28, 2009


[System Requirements]

HMSCalculate is written in Perl and uses the core language, a few additional
modules that were included with this package, and a few more modules that you
will need to install on your own.  Exactly which additional packages you need is
dependent on which operating system you intend to run HMSCalculate on.  See
OS-specific instructions below for more details.

At the very least, you will need to be able to run Perl5 and Tk on your
target machine in order to use the Community Edition of HMSCalculate.


[Installation Instructions]

* Linux, Unix, and Unix-like operating systems (Mac OS X users see below):
    
    1. Ensure that Perl5 is running on your local machine.  (Try running
    `perl -V` from the shell if you don't know whether it's already installed.
    If it's not, you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    2. Ensure that the Tk module has already been installed on your local
    machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use Tk;'` from the shell if you don't
    know whether it's already installed.  If you receive a message like, 
    "Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC" then it's not currently installed, and
    you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    3. Ensure that the XML::Simple module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use XML::Simple;'` from the shell if
    you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you receive an error
    message like, "Can't locate XML/Simple.pm in @INC" then it's not currently
    installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    4. At this point, you should have everything you need to run HMSCalculate,
    so unpack the contents of the source files into a local directory.  (This
    should create a new directory called "HMSCalculate" with all of the source
    files and support materials needed to build HMSCalculate locally.)
    
    5. Change your working directory to ./HMSCalculate/bin/ and double-check
    that HMSCalculate.pl is executable by you.
    
    6. Run HMSCalculate.pl via the `perl HMSCalculate.pl` command or the
    `./HMSCalculate.pl` command.
    
* Microsoft Windows

    1. Ensure that Perl5 is running on your local machine.  (Try running
    `c:\Perl\bin\perl -V` from an MS-DOS prompt if you don't know whether it's
    already installed.  If it's not, you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    2. Ensure that the Tk module has already been installed on your local
    machine.  (Try running `c:\Perl\bin\perl -e "use Tk;"` from an MS-DOS prompt
    if you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you receive a message
    like, "Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC" then it's not currently installed, and you
    will need to install it on your own.)
    
    3. Ensure that the XML::Simple module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `c:\Perl\bin\perl -e "use XML::Simple;"` from
    an MS-DOS prompt if you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you
    receive an error message like, "Can't locate XML/Simple.pm in @INC" then it's
    not currently installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    4. Ensure that the Tk::Icon module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `c:\Perl\bin\perl -e "use Tk::Icon;"` from
    an MS-DOS prompt if you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you
    receive an error message like, "Can't locate Tk/Icon.pm in @INC" then it's not
    currently installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    5. At this point, you should have everything you need to run HMSCalculate,
    so unpack the contents of the source files into a local directory.  (This
    should create a new directory called "HMSCalculate" with all of the source
    files and support materials needed to build HMSCalculate locally.)
    
    6. If you have already associated .pl files with your local Perl interpretor,
    change your working directory to \HMSCalculate\bin\ and double click the
    HMSCalculate.pl file.  If you have not already associated .pl files with
    your local Perl interpretor, open an MS-DOS prompt, navigate to the
    \HMSCalculate\bin\ directory and run the command
    `c:\Perl\bin\perl HMSCalculate.pl`
    
* Mac OS X:
    
    1. Ensure that Perl5 is running on your local machine.  (Try running
    `perl -V` from the shell if you don't know whether it's already installed.
    If it's not, you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    2. Ensure that the Tk module has already been installed on your local
    machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use Tk;'` from the shell if you don't
    know whether it's already installed.  If you receive a message like, 
    "Can't locate Tk.pm in @INC" then it's not currently installed, and
    you will need to install it on your own.)  NOTE:  I had difficulty installing
    Tk on OS X until I ran the standard CPAN shell as root and then forced the
    install.  My Tk installation hasn't seemed to encounter any problems as a
    result of the forced install, and HMSCalculate ran without any problems
    either.
    
    3. Ensure that the XML::Simple module has already been installed on your
    local machine.  (Try running `perl -e 'use XML::Simple;'` from the shell if
    you don't know whether it's already installed.  If you receive an error
    message like, "Can't locate XML/Simple.pm in @INC" then it's not currently
    installed, and you will need to install it on your own.)
    
    4. At this point, you should have everything you need to run HMSCalculate,
    so unpack the contents of the source files into a local directory.  (This
    should create a new directory called "HMSCalculate" with all of the source
    files and support materials needed to build HMSCalculate locally.)
    
    5. Change your working directory to ./HMSCalculate/bin/ and double-check
    that HMSCalculate.pl is executable by you.
    
    6. Run HMSCalculate.pl via the `perl HMSCalculate.pl` command or the
    `./HMSCalculate.pl` command.


[Miscellaneous Notes]

MS Windows users will most likely have a more difficult time time than Linux,
OS X, and Unix users getting HMSCalculate Community edition up and running,
because they will probably have most of what they need already installed.
MS Windows users, I recommend looking into ActiveState's ActivePerl and Googling
for ways to associate .pl with your local Perl interpreter.  This should help
HMSCalculate seem much more like a native Windows application.  To all users,
wherever possible, I recommend installing the additional modules (Tk,
XML::Simple, etc.) via your favorite package manager.  (In the case of
MS Windows users who have just installed ActivePerl, this means the "Perl
Package Manager" you just installed.)
