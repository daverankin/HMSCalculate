FIELD15 HMSCALCULATE STANDARD EDITION LICENSE AGREEMENT

*IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT*

THIS IS A LICENSE AND NOT AN AGREEMENT FOR SALE. By using and installing the HMSCalculate Software ("Software") or by choosing an "I ACCEPT..." or similarly spirited option at the end of the License you indicate that you have read, understood, and accepted the terms and conditions of the License. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL THE Software.  This License Agreement ("License") is made between Field15, Inc. ("Field15") as licensor, and you, as licensee, as of the date of your first use of the Software.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE

1. You may make unlimited copies of the Software in any medium for the purpose
of your own personal backup copies.

2. You may install and use copies of the Software on an unlimited number of
devices that you personally own.

In addition to the two specific scenarios listed in this section above, all
answers to any questions about the terms and conditions for copying,
distribution, and use of this Software allowed under this License should be
guided by the SPIRIT OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("Spirit") as follows.

The Spirit of this License, as it pertains to the copying, distribution, and
use of this Software, is guided by the principle that registered users of this
Software (that is, users who have received acknowledgement, in writing, from
Field15, one of its affiliates, distributors, or representatives, that they, as
a unique individual, are recognized as "registered") should have the ability
to copy this Software as they see fit for their own personal uses.  The
Standard Edition of this Software (for which this License is intended) is
not provided for the purpose of distribution or sale to others, because the act
of registration grants the registered user access to non-material benefits and
services including but not limited to an official support channel.  There is,
however, a Community Edition of the Software available somewhere on the
dave.caretcake website at http://dave.caretcake.com which is provided under
the terms of the GNU General Public License, and the Community Edition may be
used in all ways allowable under that license agreement.
